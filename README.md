# Hasher, v.000001

This is a GUI demonstration of hashing algorithms: MDA5, SHA1, SHA256. This is coded in Pygame and Python.

This tool allows user to enter a string and visually compare the efficiency of the three different widely used hashing algorithms. 

This is a quick project that might have several bugs. Please do not hesitate to let me know, or commit improvements where necessary.

This tool does not claim to provide a robost encyrption to hash secret keys, but it can be useful to 
visually compare widely used encryption algorithms.

If you come across any bugs, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

Also, please feel to fork and/or suggest improvements.
